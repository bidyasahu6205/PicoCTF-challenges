-In this challenge i used nc netcat command TO connect to this remote server
  syntax : nc <host> <port no.>
-The 'nc' or Netcat command in Linux is a networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP.
- then it printed a long song kind of thing but i don't time to go through each line to find the flag so i used grepp command to only print those line that contained picoCTF
and found the flag.
