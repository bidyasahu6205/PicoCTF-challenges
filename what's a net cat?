Description
Using netcat (nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org at port 25103 to get the flag?

All we need to do is connect to the target using the netcat command
COMMAND
nc -v <host> <port>

This initiates a connection as a client to a specified host (server) and port. The -v flag enables verbose mode, providing more output about the connection.

<host>: Replace this with the IP address or domain name of the server you want to connect to.
<port>: Replace this with the port number on the server you want to communicate with. Common ports include:

diva_bs-picoctf@webshell:~$ nc -v jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 25103
