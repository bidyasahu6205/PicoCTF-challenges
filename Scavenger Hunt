Search engines do something called spidering and indexing
In the context of search engines, spidering and indexing are two crucial processes that work together to enable you to find information on the web. Here's a breakdown of each concept:

1. Spidering (also known as web crawling):
* Imagine a spider spinning a web. Similarly, a search engine spider (or crawler) systematically browses the internet, discovering new web pages and following links between them. 
* The spider starts with a set of seed URLs, which can be manually defined or discovered from previous crawls.
* It then follows the links it finds on those pages, adding those URLs to its queue for further exploration. This process continues recursively, venturing deeper and discovering new pages across the web.
* Spiders can analyze various aspects of a webpage, including its content, structure, and external links. 

2. Indexing:
* Once the spider discovers a webpage, the search engine doesn't just store the URL. It performs indexing, which involves creating a massive database of information about all the discovered webpages.
* This database, called the search index, stores various details about each webpage, such as:
    * The content of the page, including keywords and phrases.
    * The structure of the page, including headings, titles, and internal links.
    * The metadata associated with the page (e.g., meta tags).
    * The external links the page points to.
* When you enter a search query into a search engine, it retrieves information from the search index to find web pages relevant to your query.

Analogy:
Think of a library. The spider is like a librarian who goes out and collects new books (web pages). Indexing is like creating a catalog system for those books, allowing you to easily find the information you need (relevant web pages based on your search query).

so sometime we don't want things to be part of the indexing of search engine and to do so 
search:  http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/robots.txt
and you'll get the flag
                    User-agent: *
                    Disallow: /index.html
                    # Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
                    # I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?

 apache server can also serve files and the way that you get that access if you looked at the documentation is there is an .htaccess file 
to do that search : http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/.htaccess
you will get
                  # Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
                  # I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.

There is an hidden file called .DS_store it stores data by tracking of what's going on with the file system check if it's available 
search : http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/.DS_Store
