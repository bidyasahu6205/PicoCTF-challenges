We know grep is used to find a certain text in a file or a file or directory.
there are many more options that comes with it which can be usefull.
here we need to find the flag which might be present in one of the file in the dirctory big-zip-files
but it will take a lot of effort and time to find the flag going through each and every directory and files.
we can use grep -r option to find the text.
this will go through each and every file in all the directories present in big-zip-files and return that certain part along with the path to the file.
you can know more about it and many more option that could be used with it in linux
by typing the command " man grep " 
man can be used with any command to know all possible use of that command.
