How to automate tasks to run at intervals on linux servers?
Use ssh to connect to this server:
Server: saturn.picoctf.net
Port: 56528
Username: picoplayer 
Password: bLgSMmbY6X

- This challege was made to make us acquainted with crontab which is used to automate tasks in linux.
- You can edit crontab using 
      crontab -e
- system-wide cron jobs might be found in the following directories:
      -> /etc/crontab
      -> /etc/cron.d/
      -> /var/spool/cron/crontabs/ (user-specific cron jobs stored here)
- so I just checked those directories and found the flag.
