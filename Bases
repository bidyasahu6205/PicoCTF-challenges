Description
What does this bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 mean? I think it has something to do with bases.

It want us to convert the cipher text format to a clear text 
and the hint in the question is it's a base encoding

so we can use online converters such as cyberchef 
or linux commands
                      base64 -d <<< text_to_be_decoded
diva_bs-picoctf@webshell:~$ base64 -d <<< bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1
l3arn_th3_r0p35
diva_bs-picoctf@webshell:~$ 

flag: picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}
