Description
This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear"). Download flag.

Now we want to find the flag in the document through webshell 
i. We will download the document first.

wget file_url

# else we can use another way 

curl -O file_url

ii. We will see if the file is downloaded or not for that we can use a command to see all the files available in that directory

ls

# this will list all the files present

iii. Then we will see whats inside the document here we will use cat command

cat file_name

it will print the content of the file
