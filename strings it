Description
Can you find the flag in file without running it?

At first i thought just printing and finding the flag would be enough but it did not worked the wayIi thought

diva_bs-picoctf@webshell:~$ ls
README.txt  strings

diva_bs-picoctf@webshell:~$ cat strings | grep pico
grep: (standard input): binary file matches

Here you can see i got an error here it says that the file contents are in binary
to print it in readable format i need to use STRING COMMANDS
The strings command in Linux is a handy tool for extracting printable strings from binary files.

diva_bs-picoctf@webshell:~$ strings strings | grep picoCTF
picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_d66c7bb7}
diva_bs-picoctf@webshell:~$ 

flag: picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_d66c7bb7}
