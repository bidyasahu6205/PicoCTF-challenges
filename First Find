Here we are supposed to find an file named uber-secret.txt from searching all the directories present in the files
here we will use a command called 'find' along with it's option -name so it will find a file or directory named whatever we give it
here the . means from that directory start finding that file or directory .
as you can see we could see the path from that directory onwards.
then we go to that directory and check the content to find the flag we required.
