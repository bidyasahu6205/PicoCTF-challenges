As you can see i couldn't use any basic commands. Then i refered the hint given i.e Experiment with different shell syntax
Thus I researched on different kind of shell syntax
i. Basic command syntax
  - ls -l /home/user
ii. Piping
  - it takes the output from first command as input for the second command
  - eg ls | grep "file"
iii. Background execution 
  - runns the command in the background
  - ls & 
and there is more to it you can use chatgpt or browser to find more of them
I used the piping command syntax

Special$ ls -la | find .
Is la | find .
