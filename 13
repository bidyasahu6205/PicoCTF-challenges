Description
Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is?

ROT13 (Rotate by 13 places) is a simple letter substitution cipher
that replaces each letter with the letter 13 places after it in the alphabet.
It is a special case of the Caesar cipher with a shift of 13.

How it Works:
Since the English alphabet has 26 letters,
applying ROT13 twice restores the original text (because 13+13 = 26).
Only alphabetical characters are affected.
Numbers, punctuation, and spaces remain unchanged.
HELLO → URYYB

so the flag is
c → p, v → i, p → c, b → o
P → C, G → T, S → F
{ remains unchanged
a → n, b → o, g → t, _ remains unchanged
g → t, b → o, b → o, _ remains unchanged
o → b, n → a, q → d, _ remains unchanged
b → o, s → f, _ remains unchanged
n → a, _ remains unchanged
c → p, e → r, b → o, o → b, y → l, r → e, z → m
} remains unchanged
