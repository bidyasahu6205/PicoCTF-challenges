A bookmarklet is a bookmark that runs JavaScript instead of loading a webpage.

so when we run the instance and click on the url we will get to a page where a javascript code will be given to get the flag we create a bookmark with the script as url 
after creating the bookmark when you click to open it the crome will run the script instead of opening the website
